{"name":"@j5bot // Jonathan 'J5' Cook","tagline":"","body":"### Getting To Know Me, Getting to Learn All About Me\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nI like patterns; taking abstract ideas and bringing them into the world of the 'real'.\r\n\r\nI <3 JS: so much so that my nickname, J5, is both a reference to the 80's movie Short Circuit's Johnny 5 robot-with-emotions and to the l33t5p34k spelling of JS.  Eeen-put, Stephanie!\r\n\r\n## Sites\r\n[Collectist: The Walking Dead](http://thewalkingdead.collectist.org)\r\nand [Collectist: Gogos Crazy Bones](http://gogos.collectist.org)\r\n\r\nTwo sites running off of the same code engine -- collectors maintain a checklist for the particular hobby (obviously I have started with toys) which is stored for them via localStorage.  The code leverages require, knockback (knockout + backbone), and a little bit of zurb foundation.\r\n\r\n[Please, view source!](view-source:http://thewalkingdead.collectist.org)\r\n\r\nUltimately the site will enable different types of checklists such as 'have', 'want', 'will sell', 'will trade', etc. as well as sharing collections with others via links.  I would like to implement distributed (i.e. via Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) as well as centralized storage options (via document store such as MongoDB); also distributed (i.e. OAuth) and centralized authentication.\r\n\r\n## Library\r\n[acid-trail](http://github.com/j5bot/acid-trail)  ([demo](http://j5bot.github.io/acid-trail/demo.html))\r\n\r\nUtility to create a memorable / human readable identifier for an object / document / state by mapping hashes to color sequences.  Integrating existing functionality from other tools to solve a new and unique problem.  Easily translates to other languages, I have implemented the code in C# as well as the javascript shown here.\r\n\r\n## Plugin / Toy\r\n[tower-egg](http://github.com/j5bot/tower-egg) ([demo](http://j5bot.github.com/tower-egg/tower.html))\r\n\r\nA small javascript puzzle game which implements the 'tower of hanoi' also known as 'lucas tower'.  Designed so it can be embedded easily as an application easter egg :)\r\n\r\n## Writings\r\n[j5bot.blogspot.com](http://j5bot.blogspot.com)\r\n\r\nI am not an extremely active blogger, but the items I have written should help demonstrate my communication skills as well as my approach to problem solving.\r\n\r\n[poemfor.us](http://poemfor.us) and [infin8ty.com](http://infin8ty.com)\r\n\r\nSome of my works as a poet.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
