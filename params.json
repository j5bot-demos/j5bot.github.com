{"name":"@j5bot // Jonathan 'J5' Cook","tagline":"","body":"### Getting To Know Me, Getting to Learn All About Me\r\n\r\n## Sample Sites\r\n[Collectist: The Walking Dead](http://thewalkingdead.collectist.org)\r\nand [Collectist: Gogos Crazy Bones](http://gogos.collectist.org)\r\n\r\nTwo sites running off of the same code engine -- collectors maintain a checklist for the particular hobby (obviously I have started with toys) which is stored for them via localStorage.  The code leverages require, knockback (knockout + backbone), and a little bit of zurb foundation.\r\n\r\n[Please, view source!](view-source:http://thewalkingdead.collectist.org)\r\n\r\nUltimately the site will enable different types of checklists such as 'have', 'want', 'will sell', 'will trade', etc. as well as sharing collections with others via links.  I would like to implement distributed (i.e. via Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) as well as centralized storage options (via document store such as MongoDB), as well as distributed (i.e. OAuth) and centralized authentication as well.\r\n\r\n## Sample Library\r\n[acid-trail](http://github.com/j5bot/acid-trail)  ([demo](http://j5bot.github.io/acid-trail/demo.html))\r\n\r\nUtility to create a memorable / human readable identifier for an object / document / state by mapping hashes to color sequences.  Integrating existing functionality from other tools to solve a new and unique problem.\r\n\r\n## Sample Plugin / Toy\r\n[tower-egg](http://github.com/j5bot/tower-egg) ([demo](http://j5bot.github.com/tower-egg/tower.html))\r\n\r\nA small javascript puzzle game which implements the 'tower of hanoi' also known as 'lucas tower'.  Designed so it can be embedded easily as an application easter egg :)\r\n\r\n## Sample Writings\r\n[j5bot.blogspot.com](http://j5bot.blogspot.com)\r\n\r\nI am not an extremely active blogger, but the items I have written should help demonstrate my communication skills as well as my approach to problem solving.\r\n\r\n### I'm hoping that you like me ...","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
