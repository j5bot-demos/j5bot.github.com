![Johnny 5 by ramenandsuch](/assets/images/johnny 5 by ramenandsuch.png)

_I like patterns; taking abstract ideas and bringing them into the world of the 'real' in order to help people get more done and have more fun._

_I <3 JS: so much so that my nickname, J5, is both a reference to the 80's movie Short Circuit's Johnny 5 robot-with-emotions and to the 13375p34k spelling of JS. Eeen-put, Stephanie!_

Basically, I've been programming since I was a kid. I have the longest and closest relationship with the Javascript programming language, having worked with it since the mid 90's. Based on my mastery of it's C-style syntax and experience with application development, I quickly picked up programming Java and C#, and soon became aware of more rigorous ways to go about solving problems than are typically associated with Javascript.


At the same time as I like to be conscious of design patterns and algorithms, my roots as something of a 'cowboy coder' mean that I can get things done and think outside of the proverbial box.


While I'm versed in many of the latest frameworks and tech like React, React-Redux, AngularJS and Angular2, I don't use the latest and greatest just because it's cool. That's not me. I want to use the right tool for the job and sometimes that means building out your own tooling, embracing functional programming, hardcore meta-programming, and more.

Code
----

### GitHub

[github](http://github.com/j5bot?tab=repositories)

View all my repos and the repos I've forked.

### Libraries/Tools

[â„«ngsturm](http://github.com/j5bot/angsturm) ([demo](http://www.angsturm.org/demo.html))

A toolkit extending AngularJS by introducing composite multi-aspect components. Composition occurs along many lines including heirarchy, layout, component definition, component configuration, component behavior, and contract/data consumption.

As a fledgling toolkit, it is presented in the form of an example application, the [Interface Designer](http://www.angsturm.org/demo.html). To get to know how the toolkit works, you will need to examine the example application code's configurations and data along with the angsturm.js code itself..

[acid-trail](http://github.com/j5bot/acid-trail) ([demo](http://j5bot.github.io/acid-trail/demo.html))

Utility to create a memorable / human readable identifier for an object / document / state by mapping hashes to color sequences. Integrating existing functionality from other tools to solve a new and unique problem. Easily translates to other languages, I have implemented the code in C# as well as the javascript shown here.

##### Plugin / Toy

[tower-egg](http://github.com/j5bot/tower-egg) ([demo](http://j5bot.github.com/tower-egg/tower.html))

A small javascript puzzle game which implements the 'tower of hanoi' also known as 'lucas tower'. Designed so it can be embedded easily as an application easter egg :)

##### HTML5 Shim

[web worker shim](https://github.com/j5bot/html5-shims) (defunct)

Before the announcement of Chrome Frame, I was working on a shim for HTML5 Web Worker API based off of Google Gears. After the announcement I mothballed the project. It still stands as an example of my 'raw' JS programming.

Past Work
---------

### Demo Reel

A video demo reel showing my work on the Infiniti Global Korea CMS project.

Music: Symmetry by [Mew](http://www.mewsite.com/) from the Frengers album.

Sites
-----

##### Prototypes

[Collectist: The Walking Dead](https://j5bot.github.io/thewalkingdead.collectist.org) and [Collectist: Gogos Crazy Bones](https://https://j5bot.github.io/gogos.collectist.org)

Two sites running off of the same code engine &emdash; collectors maintain a checklist for the particular hobby (obviously I have started with toys) which is stored for them via localStorage. The code leverages require, knockback (knockout + backbone), and a little bit of zurb foundation.

When completed, the site will enable different types of checklists such as 'have', 'want', 'will sell', 'will trade', etc. as well as sharing collections with others via links. I would like to implement distributed (i.e. via Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) as well as centralized storage options (via document store such as MongoDB); also distributed (i.e. OAuth, OpenID) and centralized authentication.


##### The Past

[Simpsons Collector Sector](http://simpsonscollectors.com)

A site built around and for the community of the Simpsons Collector Sector message board. The site served as the primary hub for information and socializing around the Playmates' 'World of Springfield' line of Simpsons toys that were produced from 2000-2004.

While the language (VBScript/Classic ASP) and the coding is well below my current standards, it still represents the implementation of a large hand-rolled application with important features like image manipulation, CMS, blog, user management, etc.

[GEKE.NET](http://geke.net)

Also very old, a site which contains portfolio sections for design and programming that make me cringe a bit. This site hosts lots of code I wrote for users of EzBoard (now Yuku), and [an older page linking to code demos and source](http://geke.net/portfolio/demos/index.html).

This code is good to look at if you're interested in my skills in programming JS / DHTML without frameworks as most of the code is made from scratch.

Writings
--------

##### Technical

[medium@j5bot](https://medium.com/@j5bot) and [j5bot.blogspot.com](http://j5bot.blogspot.com)

I am not an extremely active blogger, but the items I have written should help demonstrate my communication skills as well as my approach to problem solving.

##### Personal

[poemfor.us](http://poemfor.us) and [infin8ty.com](http://infin8ty.com)

Some of my works as a poet.
