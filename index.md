### Getting To Know Me, Getting to Learn All About Me

## Introduction
<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2e019ae1c4a0ea28fa70280a1ac56f18.png" alt="J5" /> I like patterns; taking abstract ideas and bringing them into the world of the 'real'.

I <3 JS: so much so that my nickname, J5, is both a reference to the 80's movie Short Circuit's Johnny 5 robot-with-emotions and to the l33t5p34k spelling of JS.  Eeen-put, Stephanie!

## Sites
### Recent
[Collectist: The Walking Dead](http://thewalkingdead.collectist.org)
and [Collectist: Gogos Crazy Bones](http://gogos.collectist.org)

Two sites running off of the same code engine -- collectors maintain a checklist for the particular hobby (obviously I have started with toys) which is stored for them via localStorage.  The code leverages require, knockback (knockout + backbone), and a little bit of zurb foundation.

[Please, view source!](view-source:http://thewalkingdead.collectist.org)

Ultimately the site will enable different types of checklists such as 'have', 'want', 'will sell', 'will trade', etc. as well as sharing collections with others via links.  I would like to implement distributed (i.e. via Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) as well as centralized storage options (via document store such as MongoDB); also distributed (i.e. OAuth, OpenID) and centralized authentication.

### Old Stuff

[Simpsons Collector Sector](http://simpsonscollectors.com)

A site built around and for the community of the Simpsons Collector Sector message board.  The site served as the primary hub for information and socializing around the Playmates' 'World of Springfield' line of Simpsons toys that were produced from 2000-2004.

While the language (VBScript/Classic ASP) and the coding is well below my current standards, it still represents the implementation of a large hand-rolled application with important features like image manipulation, CMS, blog, user management, etc.

## Code Projects
### GitHub
[github](http://github.com/j5bot?tab=repositories)

View my repos and the repos I've forked.

### Library
[acid-trail](http://github.com/j5bot/acid-trail)  ([demo](http://j5bot.github.io/acid-trail/demo.html))

Utility to create a memorable / human readable identifier for an object / document / state by mapping hashes to color sequences.  Integrating existing functionality from other tools to solve a new and unique problem.  Easily translates to other languages, I have implemented the code in C# as well as the javascript shown here.

### Plugin / Toy
[tower-egg](http://github.com/j5bot/tower-egg) ([demo](http://j5bot.github.com/tower-egg/tower.html))

A small javascript puzzle game which implements the 'tower of hanoi' also known as 'lucas tower'.  Designed so it can be embedded easily as an application easter egg :)
