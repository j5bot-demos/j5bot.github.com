## Introduction

[![Johnny 5 by ramenandsuch](/assets/images/johnny 5 by ramenandsuch.png)](https://go.jonathancook.site/johnny-5-by-ramenandsuch)

_I like patterns; taking abstract ideas and bringing them into the world of the
'real' in order to help people get more done and have more fun._

_I <3 JS: so much so that my nickname, J5, is both a reference to the 80's movie
Short Circuit's Johnny 5 robot-with-emotions and to the 13375p34k spelling of
JS. Eeen-put, Stephanie!_

Basically, I've been programming since I was a kid. I have the longest and
closest relationship with the Javascript programming language, having worked
with it since the mid 90's. Based on my mastery of it's C-style syntax and
experience with application development, I quickly picked up programming Java
and C#, and soon became aware of more rigorous ways to go about solving problems
than are typically associated with Javascript.

At the same time as I like to be conscious of design patterns and algorithms, my
roots as something of a 'cowboy coder' mean that I can get things done and think
outside of the proverbial box.

While I'm versed in many of the latest frameworks and tech like React,
React-Redux, AngularJS and Angular2, I don't use the latest and greatest just
because it's cool. That's not me. I want to use the right tool for the job and
sometimes that means building out your own tooling, embracing functional
programming, meta-programming, and more.

## Code

### GitHub

[github](https://go.jonathancook.site/github-repos)

View all my repos and the repos I've forked.

### Demo Projects

[deck-of-cards](https://go.jonathancook.site/deck-of-cards-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/deck-of-cards-demo))

An ES6 implementation of a deck of playing cards, including mix-ins, base
classes, and more.  In addition to implementing a standard deck of playing
cards, the code is extensible and can be used as the basis of any kind of card
deck.

As this is base code which doesn't include any implementation using the classes
the demo site shows information for various project metrics such as code
coverage and complete report of test results.  The test results reporting is
done using React components.

[React Deck-of-Cards](https://go.jonathancook.site/react-deck-of-cards-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/react-deck-of-cards-demo))

A React UI using CSS3 Flexbox, showing an implementation of shuffling and
dealing using the
[deck-of-cards](https://go.jonathancook.site/deck-of-cards-repo) code.  Also
allows for changing the card face design between the English pattern and a
Russian "Atlas" design.


### Libraries/Tools

[Ångsturm](https://go.jonathancook.site/angsturm-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/angsturm-demo))

A toolkit extending AngularJS by introducing composite multi-aspect components.
Composition occurs along many lines including heirarchy, layout, component
definition, component configuration, component behavior, and contract/data
consumption.

As a fledgling toolkit, it is presented in the form of an example application,
the [Interface Designer](https://go.jonathancook.site/angsturm-demo).
To get to know how the toolkit works, you will need to examine the example
application code's configurations and data along with the angsturm.js code
itself.

[acid-trail](https://go.jonathancook.site/acid-trail-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/acid-trail-demo))

Utility to create a memorable / human readable identifier for an object /
document / state by mapping hashes to color sequences. Integrating existing
functionality from other tools to solve a new and unique problem. Easily
translates to other languages, I have implemented the code in C# as well as the
javascript shown here.

#### Plugin / Toy

[tower-egg](https://go.jonathancook.site/tower-egg-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/tower-egg-demo))

A small javascript puzzle game which implements the 'tower of hanoi' also known
as 'lucas tower'. Designed so it can be embedded easily as an application easter
egg :)

#### HTML5 Shim

[web worker shim](https://go.jonathancook.site/web-worker-shim-repo)
  (defunct)

Before the announcement of Chrome Frame, I was working on a shim for HTML5 Web
Worker API based off of Google Gears. After the announcement I mothballed the
project. It still stands as an example of my 'raw' JS programming.

## Past Work

### Demo Reel

Music: Symmetry by [Mew](http://www.mewsite.com/) from the Frengers album.

## Sites

### Prototypes

[Collectist: The Walking Dead](https://go.jonathancook.site/thewalkingdead-collectist-org) and
  [Collectist: Gogos Crazy Bones](https://go.jonathancook.site/gogos-collectist-org)

Two sites running off of the same code engine — collectors maintain a checklist
for the particular hobby (obviously I have started with toys) which is stored
for them via localStorage. The code leverages require, knockback (knockout +
backbone), and a little bit of zurb foundation.

When completed, the site will enable different types of checklists such as
'have', 'want', 'will sell', 'will trade', etc. as well as sharing collections
with others via links. I would like to implement distributed (i.e. via Dropbox,
Google Drive, etc.) as well as centralized storage options (via document store
such as MongoDB); also distributed (i.e. OAuth, OpenID) and centralized
authentication.

### The Past

[Simpsons Collector Sector](https://go.jonathancook.site/simpsons-collectors)

A site built around and for the community of the Simpsons Collector Sector
message board. The site served as the primary hub for information and
socializing around the Playmates' 'World of Springfield' line of Simpsons toys
that were produced from 2000-2004.

While the language (VBScript/Classic ASP) and the coding is well below my
current standards, it still represents the implementation of a large hand-rolled
application with important features like image manipulation, CMS, blog, user
management, etc.

[GEKE.NET](https://go.jonathancook.site/geke-net)

Also very old, a site which contains portfolio sections for design and
programming that make me cringe a bit. This site hosts lots of code I wrote for
users of EzBoard (now Yuku), and
[an older page linking to code demos and source](https://go.jonathancook.site/geke-net-demos).

This code is good to look at if you're interested in my skills in programming JS
/ DHTML without frameworks as most of the code is made from scratch.

I am not an extremely active blogger, but the items I have written should help
demonstrate my communication skills as well as my approach to problem solving.
