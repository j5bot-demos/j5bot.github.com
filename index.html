<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I like patterns; taking abstract ideas and bringing them into the world of the 'real'.</p>

<p>I &lt;3 JS: so much so that my nickname, J5, is both a reference to the 80's movie Short Circuit's Johnny 5 robot-with-emotions and to the l33t5p34k spelling of JS.  Eeen-put, Stephanie!</p>

<h2>Sites</h2>

<p><a href="http://thewalkingdead.collectist.org">Collectist: The Walking Dead</a>
and <a href="http://gogos.collectist.org">Collectist: Gogos Crazy Bones</a></p>

<p>Two sites running off of the same code engine -- collectors maintain a checklist for the particular hobby (obviously I have started with toys) which is stored for them via localStorage.  The code leverages require, knockback (knockout + backbone), and a little bit of zurb foundation.</p>

<p><a>Please, view source!</a></p>

<p>Ultimately the site will enable different types of checklists such as 'have', 'want', 'will sell', 'will trade', etc. as well as sharing collections with others via links.  I would like to implement distributed (i.e. via Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) as well as centralized storage options (via document store such as MongoDB); also distributed (i.e. OAuth) and centralized authentication.</p>

<h2>Library</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/j5bot/acid-trail">acid-trail</a>  (<a href="http://j5bot.github.io/acid-trail/demo.html">demo</a>)</p>

<p>Utility to create a memorable / human readable identifier for an object / document / state by mapping hashes to color sequences.  Integrating existing functionality from other tools to solve a new and unique problem.  Easily translates to other languages, I have implemented the code in C# as well as the javascript shown here.</p>

<h2>Plugin / Toy</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/j5bot/tower-egg">tower-egg</a> (<a href="http://j5bot.github.com/tower-egg/tower.html">demo</a>)</p>

<p>A small javascript puzzle game which implements the 'tower of hanoi' also known as 'lucas tower'.  Designed so it can be embedded easily as an application easter egg :)</p>

<h2>Writings</h2>

<p>I am not an extremely active blogger, but the items I have written should help demonstrate my communication skills as well as my approach to problem solving.</p>
