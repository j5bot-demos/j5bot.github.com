A virtual [goniometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goniometer) which allows
medical practitioners to measure the angle describing the range of motion of a
patient's joint displayed in a recorded video.

The Angulator tool was first created in one evening after a brief discussion
with ViiMed's CEO, Phil Newman.  I saw a drawing on a whiteboard and inquired
about it.  Phil told me that it was a tool that if we could create a software
version of, it could help us land a multi-million dollar contract.  That night
a working version of the tool was completed.

It was later included in a patent filed by ViiMed for various elements of the
company's software and was also featured prominently in several web videos, as
well as being extremely well received at trade shows.
